Yet another sparse linear algebraic routines package for R, with functions tailored for spatio-temporal modelling  and inference with Gaussian Markov Random Fields.

To install this, first load devtools (needs R3.0 and above) and then, in R, load the package and type "install_git("https://github.com/andrewzm/linalg")"
